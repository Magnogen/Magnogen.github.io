				The perpetual night
		    </h1>
            The sky: dim, dark, eerie… The black void seemed to stretch out to eternity. The moon: waning, slowly shrinking back into the dark pit of the sky. The floor: cobbled, uncomfortable, and yet there was a woman lying there – her back resting against the stump of a tree. If you were to get closer, you may hear the faint snore emanating from her throat. If you were to get closer still, you may hear a small voice shouting inside her head: “Wake up! Wake up!” The voice belonged to a woman who looked remarkably similar to the dreamer – dark brown hair, navy eyes, pale (but slightly tanned) skin, however there were a few striking differences: the feline she had tucked under her arm seemed fearful – a wide-eyed expression on its face, her clothes were torn – a diagonal slash had cut her blouse from left to right; the remains frayed with loose threads flailing in the breeze, her jeans had gaping holes – showing bare skin beneath and her left shoe had been lost. The cat began to yowl and, when it did, everything disappeared in order to be replaced by the physical world.<br>
<br>
“AHH!” The newly-awakened dreamer shouted as soon as she opened her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Oh Andy, I had the most ghastly dream…” She began to shiver. “Could you close the window? Andy?”<br>
<br>
She shivered again, and on realising she wasn’t in her regular bedroom muttered to herself: “Where am I?” She sits up and looks around. She couldn’t see anything so she tenderly feels around her. Her hand struck the mossy ground beneath her, she quickly withdrew (she’s never liked the texture of moss against her skin – and unfortunately, the bullies had used this against her up until she left school – about five years ago now.) As she felt behind her, she could feel the rough surface of the tree bark behind her she felt her way up to the smooth edge of the tree stump, about a foot and a half off the ground. As her eyes adjusted to the dark, she could make out the silhouette of a pub sign on the wall. Soon, she could make out more things: windows of shops around her (some with mannequins inside, some with cuts of meat hanging from the ceiling, and some with a selection of shoes on display), and a rather large fountain-shaped ornament in the middle. Above her head was a billboard advertising a bed and breakfast service. A warm, cosy, relaxing bed… How she wished she was there now…<br>
<br>
Suddenly the clang of a dustbin lid hitting the floor interrupted her daydream. Her leg muscles tensed up, ready to run and hide. A blur of movement flashed past her peripherals.<br>
<br>
She sped off into the depths of the city.<br>
<br>
Without turning back she carried on sprinting as fast as she could. In doing so, she zoomed past a lamppost which seemed to reach out and snatch the lower half of her blouse. It ripped away – no need to worry about that now. She could hear the constant drumming against the floor behind her. The constant threat of being attacked by the figure behind petrified her. Her breathing went into a rage. She turned a corner and directly in front of her was a blockade of boxes, bins and planks of wood. She turned around and tried to find a way out, her eyes had become foggy and so she could only make out the figure advancing towards her – a rather small figure. She tried to wipe her eyes to remove the fog and in doing so the creature that had been chasing her leaped at her. She scrambled backwards and fell over onto her backside in awe – the pursuer was just a small, black cat that was obviously out of breath from the all the running about. It was so out of breath that it curled up in her lap and fell asleep.<br>
<br>
The woman started shaking. Shaking with laughter! “How could I have been so foolish?” She thought to herself. She wiped the tears from her eyes and then gasped in disbelief upon seeing the cat clearly for the first time. “But, this is exactly the same cat from my dream! How is that even possible? Maybe it’s just a coincidence…” She looked down at herself: her top was torn from the lamppost grabbing her – this had cut the top from left to right, the edges were frayed with loose threads flailing in the breeze and her jeans had gaping holes – showing bare skin beneath. Just like her dream.<br>
<br>
She noticed something tucked under the collar of the scruffy cat which was quietly purring on her lap – a white rectangle. She carefully slid it out and unfolded it. On it wrote: “It’s a loop – everything in your dream will come happen again, and again: the wind will blow this note away, so you’ll need to write it down again and slide it under the cat’s collar!” At that moment, a sudden gust of wind flew down the alleyway, dislodging the paper from the woman’s clutches. The paper danced above her head for a few seconds and then flew over the fence behind her. The woman was in utter shock. “What just happened?” She thought “How did that message know what was going to happen? Unless everything really is repeating again and again…”<br>
<br>
She sat there and pondered for a while. And then decided to go and do what the memo had said – she remembered seeing a printery by the area in which she was first found herself and started heading in that direction.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;">• • • • • • • • •</div>
<br>
The printery had a dozen stacks of paper on the floor – each about twice as tall as the cat who had decided to join her in the printery. She grabbed the top-most slip and wrote the message (the one that she had earlier read) onto the slip with a pencil she found on a desk nearby. She folded it up and tucked it under the moggy’s collar. She suddenly heard a whooshing, whistling sound outside, so she decided to go out and see what all the noise was. Her newly-found companion followed her.<br>
<br>
Outside, there was a bright blue light seemingly pulsating in the middle of the open space. It floated off in a topological frenzy – so fast that she had to pick up the cat in her arms and run after it to see where it was going. As it got closer to the tree stump, it slowed down to a steady pace.<br>
<br>
It stopped. Directly above the tree stump she was originally resting against. The bright blue rectangle encircled the blue, pulsating light. The woman was confused. Suddenly a flashing red dot appeared in the corner of the rectangle and she knew what that meant – time to complete this vicious circle…<br>
<br>
“Wake up!” She shouted, still slightly out of breath from the chasing of the light. “Wake up!” She screamed into what she thought must be a camera. She glanced down and noticed that her clothes were torn – a diagonal slash had cut her blouse from left to right (that dreaded lamppost); the remains had frayed with loose threads flailing in the breeze, her jeans had gaping holes – showing her pale skin beneath and her left shoe had been lost (probably on the pursuit of the pulsating glow). The cat – held tightly beneath her arm – began to yowl as she was squeezing him too hard and, as the noise hung in the air, everything disappeared in order to be replaced by the physical world…<br>
<br>
As everything was fading out of existence, she could hear a faint scream in the distance: “AHH! Oh Andy, I had the most…” The rest was cut off as she ceased to exist.<br>
