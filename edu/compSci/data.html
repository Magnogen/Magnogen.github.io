				Using binary
		    </h2>
				Binary is used to represent data and instructions in a program.
		    <br><br>
		    <div class="sub">
			But what's so special about binary?
		    </div>
				Computer processors contain billions of transistors (like
		    a switch) that only have two states: on and off (like a
		    switch again).
		    <br>
		    Because there are only 2 states, binary is used to represent
		    these states and thus determine what the computer should do.
		    <br><br>
		    <div class="sub">
				The binary system
		    </div>
		    The two states in binary are represented by 1 (on) and 0 (off).
		    These are called 'binary digits' or 'bits'. All instructions and
		    data including graphics and sound are represented as millions of
		    bits.
		    <br><br>
		    <div class="sub">
            	Why are binary numbers so long?
            </div>
		    Because binary only has two numbers, you need multiple digits to
		    symbolise the same value. (For example, 42, while only needing 2
		    digits in 'standard' numbering, requires 6 digits in binary
		    numbering [101010]) This results in a generally longer number, when
            compared to other forms of numbering.
		    <br><br>
		    <h2 style="color: #00a8ff" id="conversion">
				Converting to binary
		    </h2>
            You can convert 'standard' (also called 'decimal' or 'denary')
            numbers with values between 0 and 255 into 8-bit binary numbers
            (binary numbers with 8 digits). Denary numbers above 255 need more
            digits. I have made a video on YouTube for converting denar
            numbers to binary and vice versa. You can see it here:

				Shifts
		    </h2>
            <div class="sub">
            	What are they?
            </div>
            Shifts are used when you want to multiply or divide binary
            numbers by a number which is a power of 2 (including: 2, 4, 8, 16,
            32, 64, etc). Shifts aren't just restricted to binary
            though, it is also used in decimal, except what you do is multiply
            or divide by a number which is a power of 10 (including: 10, 100,
            1000, etc.). There are 2 types of shift: Logical shift and
            Arithmetic shift, the difference is that Arithmetic shifts are used
            for binary numbers with a negative value. You can learn about that <a href="/edu/compSci/data.html#negativeBinary">here</a>
            <br><br>
            <div class="sub">
            	How do I perform a logical shift?
            </div>
            To perform a logical shift, just move all the digits along a
            column, for instance,
            <br>
            <div class="num">
            	0|0|0|1|0|1|1|1 (23)
            </div>
            <br>
            would become:
            <br>
            <div class="num">
            	0|0|1|0|1|1|1|0 (46)
            </div>
            <br>
            When performing a logical shift of +1 (also called x2).
            <br><br>
            And the same number, once a logical shift of -1 has taken place,
            would become this:
            <br>
            <div class="num">
            	0|0|0|0|1|0|1|1 (11)
            </div>
            <br>
            However this example would not also be called ÷2 because the one on
            the end has been lost to oblivion and so it will be 0.5 less than
            the half of 00010111.
            <br><br>
            <div class="sub">
            	How do I perform an arithmetic shift?
            </div>To perform an arithmetic shift, just move all but the first
            digit along a column, for instance,
            <br>
            <div class="num">
            	1|0|0|1|0|1|1|1 (23)
            </div>
            <br>
            would become:
            <br>
            <div class="num">
            	1|0|1|0|1|1|1|0 (46)
            </div>
            <br>
            When performing an arithmetic shift of +1 (also called x2).
            <br><br>
            And the same number, once a logical shift of -1 has taken place,
            would become this:
            <br>
            <div class="num">
            	1|1|0|0|1|0|1|1 (11)
            </div>
            <br>
            Notice that the 1 on the left-most end of the number stays as it
            is. This is the case no matter which number it is. Also notice that
            the second digit from the left is a 1, this is because the number
            is carried along. More about this in the <a href="/edu/compSci/data.html#negativeBinary">Negative numbers</a> section.

				Negative numbers
		    </h2>
            Negative numbers are useful, there's almost no doubt about that,
            but how can you write down a negative number in binary? There are
            two ways: "Sign and magnitude" and "Two's complement". Each have
            their limitations, but I'll show you how to use both.
            <br><br>
            <div class="sub">
            	Sign and magnitude
            </div>
            In this method, the digit at the far left is known as the Most
            Significant Bit (MSB). The MSB is used to determine wether or not
            the number is positive (when it is 0) or negative (when it is 1).
            The MSB is the sign and the rest of the number is the magnitude,
            hence why this method is called "Sign and magnitude".
            <br><br>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <div class="num">
            	<b>0</b>|0|0|0|1|0|1|0 (+10)
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="num">
            	<b>1</b>|0|0|0|1|0|1|0 (-10)
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <div class="sub">
            	Two's complement
            </div>
            This format is more common when compared to Sign and magnitude, but
            it is slightly harder to understand. But why use this instead of
            Sign and magnitude? Because Sign and magnitude has two vaules for
            0: +0 (<div class="num-brackets"><b>0</b>|0|0|0|0|0|0|0</div>), and
            -0 (<div class="num-brackets"><b>1</b>|0|0|0|0|0|0|0</div>). Even
            though these two values are exactly the same, they have differing
            Sign and magnitude representations. Two's complement fixes this
            problem.
            <br><br>
            Step 1: Choose a number. (I'll choose 10)<br>
            Step 2: Find positive binary value. (10 = <div class="num-brackets">0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0</div>)<br>
            Step 3: Flip all the bits. (<div class="num-brackets">0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0</div> becomes <div class="num-brackets">1|1|1|1|0|1|0|1</div>)<br>
            Step 4: Add 1 (<div class="num-brackets">1|1|1|1|0|1|0|1</div> +
            <div class="num-brackets">1</div> = <div class="num-brackets">1|1|1|1|0|1|<b>1</b>|<b>0</b></div>)
