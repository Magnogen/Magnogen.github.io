			How to make a good network policy
		</h2>
            A network policy is used to show the users of the network the rules of using
           	the network. If you want to make a policy for your network, you can address the
            problems of the following scenarios:<br><br>
            <div class="num"> 
              • A user accidentally installs a virus onto the network<br><br>
              • A user attempts to change the configuration of the network<br><br>
              • A user uses a node on the network for unintended purposes<br><br>
              • A user brings in a virus onto the network via external drive<br><br>
              • A user forgets to log off of their computer - only for a hacker to come
              along and use it<br><br>
              • A user gives their password to other employees - the employees can thus
              tell a hacker<br><br>
              • A user reveals their personal information<br><br>
              • A user bypasses the security software<br><br>
              • A user downloads an unknown attachment<br><br>
            </div><br><br>
            If your policy contains rules that people can follow to avoid the reprocussions
            of these events, it is a good policy.
