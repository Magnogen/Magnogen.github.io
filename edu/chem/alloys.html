				Chemistry: Alloys
			</h1>
            On the periodic table, there are about 91 metals. However, even
            though there are quite a lot of them, there are still more metals
            that we need to use. Consider brass, this is used to make quite a
            lot of the parts of a saxophone and yet, no matter how hard you
            look, you won't find it on the periodic table. Why? Because the
            metals on the periodic table are malleable - so they can easily be
            shaped however you want it. This isn't a good thing, especially in
            saxophones, as the sound that comes out of a saxophone may be
            distorted - just by holding it. So, in order to make saxophones
            more durable, we make them out of alloys. But how? Let's find
            out...
            <br><br>
            <div class="sub">
            	How can we make alloys?
            </div>
            Alloys are made by melting multiple mettals and then puttung
            together into one giant lump of metal. For instance, to make the
            brass in a saxophone, you need to melt copper and zinc (both
            elements found on the periodic table) together.
            <br><br>
            But it's not that easy. Copper and zinc both have <i>really</i>
            high melting points (copper: 1,085°C, zinc: ~420°C). And then once
            you melt those, you need to mix them together in a specific ratio
            (~70% copper, and ~30% zinc) to form the perfect brass. Trust me,
            it's really difficult.
            <br><br>
            (Side note: If you want to make brass at
            home, seek parent's permission and also try not to burn yourself,
            or melt yourself...)
